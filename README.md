# my-first-repo

Hello,
I am a 24 year old who lives in Brooklyn, New York with my boyfriend and cat. 
I work at Wegmans in the catering department and have been with the company for 3 years. 
My favorite activites include reading, listening to music, grabbing good food and drinks with my friends, and sitting in the park.
